# Payment

From the start of the 2023/24 season, the club will begin paying all senior club umpires. This policy has the following aims:

- Encourage more senior players to umpire for the club
- Reduce number of players lost to weekend work shifts
- Encourage parents and friends of the club to be involved via umpiring
- Provide a standard basis on which the club can appoint external umpires

The committee considered different ways of supporting umpires and encouraging more players to help the club by officiating matches, for instance giving discounts to player/umpires. However, our umpires have varied relationships to the club; to be consistent, fair, and easy to manage, the club has decided to pay all umpires for senior games.

The payment for a senior game during the 2023/24 season will be £20 per game. It is not our intention to pay umpires for junior games at this stage.
