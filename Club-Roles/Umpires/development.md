# Getting into Umpiring
Depending on how seriously you want to take your umpiring, there is a whole regional/national program you can get involved in, however we've summarized the basic pathway below.

### Getting Started
- Let us know you are interested in umpiring by completing the form here [https://forms.gle/dDZ3EN6sVo3CcmeH7](https://forms.gle/dDZ3EN6sVo3CcmeH7) or by contacting your team captain or a member of the committee
- Sign up for England Hockey Hockey Hub https://hockeyhub.englandhockey.co.uk/officiating you can find (almost) everything you need here they even have a 'getting into umpiring' section [https://www.englandhockey.co.uk/deliver/officiate/umpire/getting-started](https://www.englandhockey.co.uk/deliver/officiate/umpire/getting-started)
- Run through the 'Learn the rules' module [https://hockeyhub.englandhockey.co.uk/rules](https://hockeyhub.englandhockey.co.uk/rules), complete the exam and download your certificate (you might need it later depending on how far you want to take it)
- We will be in touch to say welcome and talk through any questions you might have.
- Our Welfare Officer will be in touch to organise completion of safeguarding training [https://hockeyhub.englandhockey.co.uk/safeguarding_awareness](https://hockeyhub.englandhockey.co.uk/safeguarding_awareness) and a DBS check.
- You might find it useful to complete the introduction to umpiring course [https://hockeyhub.englandhockey.co.uk/events?search=introduction+to+umpi](https://hockeyhub.englandhockey.co.uk/events?search=introduction+to+umpi) however we will make sure you have access to other club umpires to ask questions of if you want to skip this step
- We can introduce you to umpiring in person at junior/senior training sessions
- Once you are feeling confident we can appoint you to umpire some junior games, with a support umpire alongside if you feel you need it

### Getting qualified
If you have played and umpired before, you may find you can skip the introduction steps above and progress straight to Level 1.
- You must be aged 14+ to progress to qualifications, if you aren't let us know because we can make sure you have other opportunies to develop.
- Let us know you want to continue your umpiring development.
- Book your Level 1 umpiring course [https://hockeyhub.englandhockey.co.uk/events?search=+level+1](https://hockeyhub.englandhockey.co.uk/events?search=+level+1) these can be done online or in person.
- Complete your Level 1 umpiring course, you will need to have completed the online rules exam before the course, send us proof of completion and your EH Umpire Number once it comes through.
- You are now a Level 1 (Unassessed) Umpire - Congratulations!

### Next Steps
- Sign up for the England Hockey Officiating Club [https://www.englandhockey.co.uk/deliver/officiate/umpire/eho](https://www.englandhockey.co.uk/deliver/officiate/umpire/eho) we can advise on which membership level is most appropriate.
- We can start appointing you to senior games, we can provide an opportunity to review a game with another senior umpire.
- Once you are feeling confident in your abilities, the club can support you to take your Level 1 Assessment. You will need to contact your EHO cluster lead requesting an assessment and the club can work with you and your assessor to ensure a game is available to you. [https://northwest.englandhockey.co.uk/officiating-discipline](https://northwest.englandhockey.co.uk/officiating-discipline)
- The assessor will watch you umpire a game and either pass you, or provide development notes which you can continue to work on in future games.
- Assuming you pass, you are now a Level 1 (Assessed) Umpire, Congratulations! You can now umpire any game up to Regional Premier level.

You can continue from here, there are Level 2 and Level 3 qualifications if you want to take Regional or National appointments.

### Insurance
So long as you are registered with us as an umpire and representing the club during a club appointed game or session, then you will be covered under the club insurance policy. In this case, you can join the EHO as a 'Bronze' member free of charge. However, we strongly advise you join the EHO as a silver member (Â£15pa) if you intend on umpiring regularly, at multiple clubs or in external sessions, this way you never have to worry about what cover you have and who is providing it.

### Equipment
We advise the following:
- Hockey appropriate astroturf shoes
- Smart black trousers or black hockey skort with black hockey socks. You will want to make sure you have pockets available for cards, Adidas skorts normally come with a pocket. If wearing trousers, you will want to make sure you can run in them, golf or walking trousers tend to be a good starting point.
- Smart single colour top of contrasting colour to both teams (and goalkeepers where practical). England hockey recommend Orange and Green, [https://teamwear.specialistsports.com/england-hockey-officials](https://teamwear.specialistsports.com/england-hockey-officials) obviously, Orange is less useful at Sandbach Hockey Club. It is useful to have some backup tops just incase and it is desirable that both umpires are wearing the same colour.
- Personalised tops, whistle and cards can be obtained here [https://hockeyhub.englandhockey.co.uk/shop](https://hockeyhub.englandhockey.co.uk/shop) 
- Watch, able to time for hockey. I use a Casio RFT100 which is great if you can find one as it can be programmed to only vibrate (so players aren't listening to your watch) and to buzz at 2mins and 1min remaining. There are other referee watches available, as well as app's for sports watches.

## Young Umpires
Players must be in secondary school before we will consider letting them start working on their umpiring skills. Beginning umpiring will be done in conversation with parents and coaches to ensure the young player is properly supported and able to cope with the responsibilities the role requires.

At 14, players can take the Level 1 qualification and it is the clubs intention to offer all players the Level 1 qualification between 14 and 18 as part of their hockey education.

Within the club, young umpires will be offered games within the junior section to help their development. They will have the opportunity to review their games with a senior umpire and, when appropriate, have the opportunity to umpire senior games with a senior umpire on the sideline.

Outside of the club, there are opportunities within the region for young umpires to get wider experience and the club will support our young umpires for these opportunities.
